    <h1>My Visualizations</h1>
    
    <h2>Visualization 1</h2>
    <img src="lab4.1 pt 1.png" alt="Visualization 1">
    <p>The 3 highest sales states are California, New York, and Texas.
        the lowest 3 are North dakota, Wyoming, and Idaho. It seems the higher
        sales are the ones with more of a population. </p>
    
    <h2>Visualization 2</h2>
    <img src="lab4.1 pt 2.png" alt="Visualization 2">
    <p>The highest sales was in technology, while the lowest was office supplies.
        I believe it varies by demand and needs since techonology is used more commonly. </p>
    
    <h2>Visualization 3</h2>
    <img src="lab4.1 pt 3.png" alt="Visualization 3">
    <p>Some noticeable patterns in the graph is during the winter holidays. I believe this is to be
        is because of the holidays a lot of people like gifting others the things that they sell.</p>
    
    <h2>Visualization 4</h2>
    <img src="lab4.1 pt 4.png" alt="Visualization 4">
    <p>In this graph we can see that tables are pretty good in sales, but profit wise they are below 0. 
        On the other hand paper is pretty high in profit, but somewhat low on sales.</p> 
    
    <h2>Visualization 5</h2>
    <img src="lab4.1 pt 5.png" alt="Visualization 5">
    <p>Standard class generates the highest sales out of the other 3, while same day is 
        the least amount. This can be usefull for logistics and planning by showing that people
          aren't happy about the same day price and prefer the standard class.</p>
